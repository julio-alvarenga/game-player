Character Class for Unity 3D

The Character class can be used by any humanoid-rigged model, as long as an Animator and Character Controller component are attached.
Animator controlled by Action class and Character Controller is controlled by Locomotion class, both of which are stored in the Character Class.

The Character class grabs input from the player. Directional input from the joystick is used to move the player in certain direction.
Button input is used to perform actions like jumping or rolling.
